## 🔧 Render Auto-Deploy

Your Render service should **automatically deploy** when you push to `main` branch.

**Check deployment status:**
1. Go to: https://dashboard.render.com
2. Find your service: `vfied-v4-clean`
3. Click on it to see deployment logs
4. Wait for "Deploy succeeded" message (usually 2-5 minutes)

---

## 🧪 Test After Deployment

Once Render shows "Live", test your new endpoints:

### **1. Test Shortlist (Main Endpoint)**

```bash
curl -X POST https://vfied-v4-clean.onrender.com/v1/travel/shortlist \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "location": {
      "city": "London",
      "country_code": "GB"
    },
    "mood_text": "breakfast",
    "limit": 5
  }'
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "restaurants": [
    {
      "restaurant_name": "Dishoom",
      "hero_image": "https://...",
      "rating": 4.8,
      "availability_label": "Available now",
      "distance_text": "London",
      "featured_items": [...],
      "gem_badge": null,
      "booking_link": {...}
    }
  ]
}
```

### **2. Test Coach (Enhanced)**

```bash
curl -X POST https://vfied-v4-clean.onrender.com/v1/travel/coach \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "query": "best brunch spots?",
    "location": {
      "city": "London",
      "country_code": "GB"
    }
  }'
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "response": "For brunch in London, I'd recommend...",
  "restaurants": [
    {
      "name": "Dishoom",
      "hero_image": "https://...",
      "details": "Known for Bacon Naan Roll",
      "rating": 4.8,
      ...
    }
  ],
  "quick_tips": ["🎯 Check if reservations are needed"],
  "follow_up_questions": ["Want to see more hidden gems?"]
}
```

### **3. Test OpenAPI Schema**

```bash
curl https://vfied-v4-clean.onrender.com/openapi.json
```

Should return your full OpenAPI specification.

### **4. Test Health Check**

```bash
curl https://vfied-v4-clean.onrender.com/health
```

Should show all services operational.

## 📦 Sample Data on Render

The sample restaurants are in **local JSON storage** and should deploy automatically. However, Firebase data might need to be synced.

### **If Sample Restaurants Don't Show Up:**

SSH into Render or run via Render Shell:

```bash
# In Render Dashboard > Shell
node add-sample-restaurants-rich.js
```

This will add:
- Dishoom (Indian, Cocktails)
- The Laughing Heart (Wine Bar, Hidden Gem)
- Bright (British, Seasonal)
- Padella (Italian, Pasta)

---

## 🔐 Environment Variables on Render

Make sure these are set in Render Dashboard > Environment:

**Required:**
```
PORT=3048
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
USE_GPT=true
```

**Optional (for Firebase):**
```
FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT={"type":"service_account",...}
FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=vfiedv3
```

**Optional (for external services):**
```
GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY=...
OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=...
EVENTBRITE_TOKEN=...
```

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### **Issue: "Cannot GET /v1/travel/shortlist"**

**Fix:** It's a POST endpoint, not GET. Use curl or Postman with POST method.

### **Issue: Empty restaurants array**

**Fix:** Run the sample data script:
```bash
node add-sample-restaurants-rich.js
```

Or check if Firebase is connected:
```bash
curl https://vfied-v4-clean.onrender.com/health
# Check if firebase: "operational"
```

### **Issue: "GeoPoint is not a constructor"**

**Fix:** This is a known Firebase Admin SDK issue. Restaurants are saved to local storage as fallback. They'll still work!

### **Issue: Coach returns generic responses**

**Fix:** Check if `USE_GPT=true` and `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set in Render environment variables.

### **Issue: CORS errors from frontend**

**Fix:** Your CORS is already permissive. If still having issues, check that your frontend is using the correct URL (https://vfied-v4-clean.onrender.com).

## 🔄 Auto-Deploy Settings

Render should auto-deploy on every push to `main`. If not:

1. Go to Render Dashboard
2. Select your service
3. Settings > Build & Deploy
4. Enable "Auto-Deploy: Yes"
5. Branch: `main`

---

## 📊 Monitor Deployment

### **Render Logs**

```bash
# View live logs in Render Dashboard
Dashboard > vfied-v4-clean > Logs
```

Look for:
```
✅ Firebase Admin SDK loaded successfully
✅ Enhanced Menu Manager initialized
✅ Server listening on port 3048
```

### **Health Check**

```bash
watch -n 5 'curl -s https://vfied-v4-clean.onrender.com/health | jq'
```

Should show:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "services": {
    "gpt": "operational",
    "firebase": "operational",
    "menu_manager": "operational"
  }
}
```

## 🚀 Post-Deployment Checklist

After Render deployment completes:

- [ ] Test `/v1/travel/shortlist` endpoint
- [ ] Test `/v1/travel/coach` endpoint
- [ ] Test `/v1/travel/restaurants/search` endpoint
- [ ] Test `/v1/travel/restaurants/nearby` endpoint
- [ ] Verify `/openapi.json` is accessible
- [ ] Check `/health` shows all services operational
- [ ] Test with Postman (import OpenAPI spec)
- [ ] Update frontend to use new endpoints
- [ ] Test geolocation-based search
- [ ] Verify photos/images load correctly

---

## 📱 Update Your Frontend

Once Render deployment is live, update your mobile/web app to use the new endpoints:

### **Old Code:**
```javascript
fetch('/v1/recommend', {...})
```

### **New Code:**
```javascript
// Get user's location first
navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(async (position) => {
  const response = await fetch('https://vfied-v4-clean.onrender.com/v1/travel/shortlist', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      location: {
        city: 'London',
        country_code: 'GB',
        latitude: position.coords.latitude,
        longitude: position.coords.longitude,
        search_radius_km: 5
      },
      mood_text: userInput,
      limit: 10,
      sort_by: 'distance',
      include_coach: true
    })
  });

  const data = await response.json();

  // data.restaurants[] has everything you need:
  // - hero_image, rating, review_count
  // - availability_label, distance_text
  // - featured_items, gem_badge
  // - booking_link
});
```
